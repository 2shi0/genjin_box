 This is a leverless controller for the minimalist, for those who want something simple and don't need 8 or 11 buttons.

# Explanation
![3d models](pic/genjin_box%20v7.png)
 This model is assembled by snap-fit joints without screws. There are no obvious joints or screw holes, which is cool. Buttons are also inset and do not require the use of adhesives.

![slice](pic/screenshot%202024-05-31%20144953.png)
 When printing button caps, it is **strongly recommended** to slice them standing up. If printed horizontally on the bed, the joint with the keyswitch is very easy to break.

# P.S.
 If anyone wants a version with a different number of buttons or a model that does not require a tact switch, please give me a shout. I will make it.
